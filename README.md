> A 2D Unity Game—showcasing real-time game logic, advanced event-driven architecture, and efficient use of core CS concepts.

---

## About The Project

**pixelFrontier** demonstrates mastery in OOP, live event systems, and custom data structures through a game environment. Recruiters can see hands-on evidence of your ability to translate theoretical CS into creative, performant software.

---

## Key CS Fundamentals

- Custom Data Structures: Linked lists, object pools, spatial partitioning
- Algorithms: A* pathfinding, game loop, efficient collision detection
- Design Patterns: Observer, Singleton, MVC
- Performance: Constant-time operations, resource pooling, Big-O thinking

---

## Tech Stack

- Unity (C#), CSS/JS for effects

---

## Usage

Clone and open in Unity, then run/play.

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Connected CS theory (algorithms, structures) to real-time game logic
- Used industry OOP and event-driven patterns
- Practiced performance and memory tradeoffs
